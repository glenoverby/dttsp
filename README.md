The original authors of DttSP have moved on to other things. 

The other major user of DttSP is PowerSDR, originally from Flex Radio.
PowerSDR appears to have three forks:

[https://github.com/ke9ns/PowerSDR_KE9NS_v2.8.0]

[https://github.com/US1GHQ/PowerSDR-2.8.0-SDR-1000]

[https://code.google.com/archive/p/powersdr-iq/downloads]

I've made improvements (or at least changes) to this code in my own fork of
this repository:
